          <p>Why does it feel like night today?<br>
            Something in here's not right today<br>Why am I so uptight today?<br>Paranoia's all I got left<br>I don't
            know
            what stressed me first<br>Or how the pressure was fed / but<br>I know just what it feels like<br>To have a
            voice in the back of my head<br>It's like a face that I hold inside<br>A face that awakes when I close my
            eyes<br>A face that watches every time I lie<br>A face that laughs every time I fall<br>(And watches
            everything)<br>So I know that when it's time to sink or swim<br>That the face inside is hearing me / right
            underneath my skin<br><br>It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my
            head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>It's like the face inside is right beneath my
            skin<br><br>I know I've got a face in me<br>Points out all my mistakes to me<br>You've got a face on the
            inside too<br>Your paranoia's probably worse<br>I don't know what set me off first<br>But I know what I
            can't
            stand<br>Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is<br>I can't add up to what you can but<br>Everybody
            has
            a face that they hold inside<br>A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br>A face that watches every time
            they
            lie<br>A face that laughs every time they fall<br>(And watches everything)<br>So you know that when it's
            time
            to sink or swim<br>That the face inside is watching you too / right inside your skin<br><br>It's like I'm
            paranoid looking over my back<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm
            hearing within<br>It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin<br>It's like I'm paranoid looking over
            my
            back<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>It's
            like
            the face inside is right beneath my skin<br><br>The face inside is right beneath your skin<br>The face
            inside
            is right beneath your skin<br>The face inside is right beneath your skin<br><br>The sun goes down<br>I feel
            the light betray me<br>The sun goes down<br>I feel the light betray me<br><br>It's like I'm paranoid looking
            over my back (The sun)<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing
            within<br>It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin (I feel the light betray me)<br><br>It's like
            I'm
            paranoid looking over my back (The sun)<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop
