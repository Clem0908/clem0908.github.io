          <p>Why does it feel like night today?<br>
            Something in here's not right today<br>Why am I so uptight today?<br>Paranoia's all I got left<br>I don't
            know
            what stressed me first<br>Or how the pressure was fed / but<br>I know just what it feels like<br>To have a
            voice in the back of my head<br>It's like a face that I hold inside<br>A face that awakes when I close my
            eyes<br>A face that watches every time I lie<br>A face that laughs every time I fall<br>(And watches
            everything)<br>So I know that when it's time to sink or swim<br>That the face inside is hearing me / right
            underneath my skin<br><br>It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my
            head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>It's like the face inside is right beneath my
            skin<br><br>I know I've got a face in me<br>Points out all my mistakes to me<br>You've got a face on the
            inside too<br>Your paranoia's probably worse<br>I don't know what set me off first<br>But I know what I
            can't
            stand<br>Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is<br>I can't add up to what you can but<br>Everybody
            has
            a face that they hold inside<br>A face that awakes when I close my eyes<br>A face that watches every time
            they
            lie<br>A face that laughs every time they fall<br>(And watches everything)<br>So you know that when it's
            time
            to sink or swim<br>That the face inside is watching you too / right inside your skin<br><br>It's like I'm
            paranoid looking over my back<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm
            hearing within<br>It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin<br>It's like I'm paranoid looking over
            my
            back<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within<br>It's
            like
            the face inside is right beneath my skin<br><br>The face inside is right beneath your skin<br>The face
            inside
            is right beneath your skin<br>The face inside is right beneath your skin<br><br>The sun goes down<br>I feel
            the light betray me<br>The sun goes down<br>I feel the light betray me<br><br>It's like I'm paranoid looking
            over my back (The sun)<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing
            within<br>It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin (I feel the light betray me)<br><br>It's like
            I'm
            paranoid looking over my back (The sun)<br>It's like a whirlwind inside of my head<br>It's like I can't stop

            Turn my<br>Mic up louder I got to say something<br>Lightweights step it aside when we come in<br>Feel it in
            your chest / The syllables get pumping<br>People on the street they panic and start running<br>Words on
            loose leaf sheet complete coming<br>I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumping<br>Healing the blind
            I promise to let the sun in<br>Sick of the dark ways we march to the drum and<br>Jump when they tell us that
            they wanna see jumping<br>Fuck that / I wanna see some fists pumping<br>Risk something / Take back what's
            yours<br>Say something that you know they might attack you for<br>Cause I'm sick of being treated like I
            have before<br>Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for<br>Like this war's really just a
            different brand of war<br>Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor<br>Like they understand you in the
            back of the jet / When you<br>Can't put gas in your tank / And these fuckers are<br>Laughing their way to
            the bank / And cashing their check<br>Asking you to have compassion / And have some respect<br>For a leader
            so nervous in an obvious way<br>Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay<br>And the rest of the

            Cause<br>When it gets tense I know what might happen<br>World is cold / The bold men take action<br>Have to
            react or get blown into fractions<br>Ten years old / It's something to see / Another<br>Kid my age drugged
            under a Jeep<br>Taken and bound / And found later under a tree<br>I wonder if he had thought the next one
            could be me<br>Do you see / The soldiers / They're out today they<br>Brush the dust from bulletproof vests
            away<br>It's ironic / At times like this you pray<br>But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday<br>There's
            bombs on the buses / Bikes / Roads<br>Inside your market / Your shops / Your clothes / My dad<br>He's got a
            lot of fear I know<br>But enough pride inside not to let that show<br>My brother had a book he would hold
            with pride<br>A little red cover with a broken spine<br>On the back / He hand wrote a quote inside:<br>"When
            the rich wage war it's the poor who die"<br>Meanwhile / The leader just talks away<br>Stuttering and
            mumbling for nightly news to replay<br>The rest of the world watching at the end of the day<br>Both scared
            and angry like<br>What did he say<br><br>Amen<br>Amen<br>Amen<br>Amen<br>Amen<br><br>With hands held high
